# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to assess the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting the credit risk of loans. A value of 0 in the "loan_status" column indicates a healthy loan, while a value of 1 indicates a high risk of defaulting.

## Results

- **Accuracy Score**: 0.99
- **Precision Score**: 0.88
- **Recall Score**: 0.91

## Summary

The logistic regression model was evaluated for its ability to predict both healthy loans (0) and high-risk loans (1). The results show that the model has a high level of accuracy in making these predictions, with an accuracy score of 0.99. The precision and recall scores for high-risk loans are 0.88 and 0.91, respectively, indicating a strong performance in identifying high-risk loans.

Given these results, the logistic regression model can be recommended for use in initial risk assessments. However, further refinements and evaluations might be necessary for more critical applications to ensure even better performance and robustness.
